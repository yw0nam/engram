"""Cheap, LLM-free conflict detection (CLAUDE.md Bet C).

A new fact that updates a single-valued attribute of an entity supersedes the old value. Resolution is
NON-DESTRUCTIVE: we set the old fact's `invalid_at` (world) and `expired_at` (belief) and point
`new.supersedes -> old`, preserving history so as-of queries still work.

Two detectors, both LLM-free (escalate to an LLM only for genuinely ambiguous cases — not needed here):

1. EXACT-SLOT — old and new share `(user, subject, predicate)` with a different object. Deterministic;
   the offline RuleExtractor's canonical predicates (works_at, lives_in, ...) flow through here.

2. SEMANTIC (needs a real embedder) — old and new share the *subject* and are embedding-near (same
   attribute) but the LLM extractor gave them *different free-form predicates*. This is the common,
   previously-missed case: "attends_yoga twice a week" (Aug) vs "does_yoga three times a week" (Nov) never
   shared a slot, so BOTH stayed live and the contradictory pair confused the answerer on knowledge-update
   questions. Embedding similarity over the rendered fact text catches it without an LLM call.

Single-valued is the DEFAULT: a predicate is treated as one-current-value UNLESS it is in `MULTI_VALUED`
(genuinely accumulating relations — likes, owns, visited, ...). Flipping the default (was a 3-item
allow-list) is what lets knowledge-updates actually invalidate. The semantic path is gated by similarity +
the same multi-valued guard, so accumulating preferences ("likes pizza" / "likes pasta") are never merged.
