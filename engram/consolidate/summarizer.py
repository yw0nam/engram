"""Hierarchical abstraction (CLAUDE.md §3): L2 session summaries + L3 user persona.

These are the *scaling primitives*. Instead of dragging every raw session into the read context (which
doesn't scale past a model's window — CLAUDE.md Bet A/E), consolidation distills each session into a
compact L2 summary and the whole user into an L3 persona, computed ONCE off the critical path and stored.
The read path then retrieves a small slice of summaries + the persona, so a lean context can cover many
sessions cheaply.

Everything degrades gracefully offline: with no LLM, the session summary is a trimmed excerpt and the
persona is the deterministic single-valued fact profile — so `Memory()` still works with zero setup.
